# Scientific Calculator

A simple scientific calculator application created using Python's `tkinter` library.

## Project Overview

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) based scientific calculator that provides various mathematical functionalities commonly found in scientific calculators. It offers features such as basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, square root, exponentiation, and more. The calculator GUI allows users to input expressions, perform calculations, and see the results instantly.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent
- Advanced functions: square root, cube root, exponentiation
- Constants: pi (Ï€), Euler's number (e)
- Conversion functions: degrees to radians and radians to degrees
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Libraries/Modules Used

- `tkinter`: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the calculator.
- `math`: Used to perform mathematical calculations and access mathematical constants and functions.

## Workflow

1. User launches the application.
2. The calculator GUI appears with buttons for numbers, operators, and functions.
3. User clicks the buttons to input numbers, operators, and functions.
4. The calculator displays the input expression and the calculated result.
5. The user can perform calculations and see results instantly.
6. Error handling ensures that invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `calculator.py` script to launch the calculator GUI.
4. Click the buttons to input numbers, operators, and functions.
5. The entry field displays the current input and the result of calculations.
6. To perform a calculation, click the "=" button.
